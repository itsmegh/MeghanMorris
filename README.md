# MeghanMorris.github.io

This is my current professional project website. I built the website using Boostrap for the layout and integrated jQuery and Javascript for functionality. Some of the functionality I added includes modal popups that hide of navigation bar, scrolling speed using jQuery easing, contact form functionality with firebase to save contact information and a submission confirmation. 

This website continues to be updated as I gain coding skills and new projects to share. View the live application here: www.meghansmorris.com
